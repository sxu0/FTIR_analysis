For my second cycle of the FTIR experiment, I explored several aspects: the Fourier transform (pg. 41-43, 45, 63-69, 71-72), the SNR (pg. 46-53, 60-61), the path length (pg. 54-56, 62-64), the gas cell settling time (pg. 56-60, 70), as well as water absorption (pg. 73-76). After much trial and error as well as learning, I was finally able to get the Fourier transforms very close, with the portion centred around the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption band being still weird (pg. 71-72). As for the path length, I collected a first round of data with unpolished technique that was unusable for analysis (pg. 56, 62); sadly, before I could collect better data, the gas cell went out of alignment and could not be fixed easily (pg. 63-64). The gas cell settling time appears to be small, with fairly consistent data observed in 5-second intervals after air is let into an evacuated cell (pg. 58-60, 70). Water absorption in the 2140-1970 cm<sup>-1</sup> wavenumber range was calculated as an exercise (pg 73-76). Overall, this has been a fun and fruitful experiment.
